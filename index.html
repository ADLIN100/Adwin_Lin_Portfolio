 <p>Adwin Lin just turned 21 years old, and currently in his third year at San Francisco State University, majoring in Visual Communication Design. Adwin have an older brother who is also in college with me. Born and raised in San Francisco, California, I’ve always had a passion for design and creativity. I chose this major to deepen my understanding and skills in various design principles, particularly in creating visuals using different software. I’m taking this course as part of my major and to improve my understanding of coding and web design. Learning how to code can help me understand the basics better, talking to people and becoming more familiar with it will help me develop more dynamic and user-friendly designs. I look forward to learning as much as I can in this course to become a more well-rounded designer and build a strong foundation for my future career.</p>

<p>My life at SFSU has been great so far meeting new people around the community and in class as well. Adwin feel he's part of the community here at SFSU because everyone is supportive and he love it here. His favorite place on campus is the gym where he go play basketball with his friends and the arcade area. In his free time, he enjoy spending time with my friends. We often go out to catch the latest movies that are interesting, funny, and that are nice to watch or head to the park to play basketball. I also love trying out different types of food from certain places or countries, whether it's new restaurants or unique dishes created at home. When I'm relaxing at home I like playing games on my phone with my friends to just chill and have fun. My favorite games are NBA 2k, Madden NFL, and GTA.</p>
