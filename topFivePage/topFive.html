  <h2>My top 5 favorite cars</h2>  
  <ul>
      <li>BMW i8</li>
        <br>
        <img src="img/BMW_i8.jpg" alt="A BMW i8 is light sliver or blue, with blue on the bottom and a two door car in a parking lot"   width="60%" height="60%">
        <p>I like BMW i8 because it's look nice and it got butterfly doors. Also it blends striking innovative design with advanced hybrid technology, creating a unique fun driving experience.</p>

      <li>Nissan G-TR Nismo R35</li>
        <br>
        <img src="img/Nissan-GTR.jpg"  alt="It's a gray Nissan G-TR Nismo R35, has red, blue, with two doors, and a black wing on the back. It's park at a random parking lot"   width="60%" height="60%">
        <p>Nissan GTR would be my next on the list because I watched all the fast and furious movies and how one of the main character drove the car and I admire how the GTR's high performance and iconic status are showcased in the series, making it a symbol of speed and power.</p>

      <li>2022 Lexus LC</li>
        <br>
        <img src="img/Lexus_hybrid.jpg"  alt="This one is a white 2022 Lexus LC with black and sliver rim, two doors, is a hybrid and background have some trees in the back"  width="60%" height="60%">
        <p>A 2022 Lexus LC would be another favorite car because I see it a lot in public, went to a Car show recently here in SF and saw the exact same model of the car and it got some features in the car that can helped you with driving. I just love the car and hopefully I can have one in the future.</p>

      <li>Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray</li>
        <br>
        <img src="img/Corvette_E-ray.avif"  alt="A light gray Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray with two doors and black rim drving on the road"   width="60%" height="60%">
        <p>This one is my next favorite is a Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray because their are a lot of different kinds of model but they all look the same from certain time of the year. The E-Ray stands out by blending that iconic Corvette look with cutting-edge hybrid technology, the sound is loud and fast to make it unique.</p>
      
      <li>Porsche 911</li>
        <br>
        <img src="img/porsche_911.avif"  alt="A Porsche 911 is sliver with two doors, black tires, and a nice looking background with trees and grass"   width="60%" height="60%">
        <p>I chose a Porsche 911 because it's a popular car, I see it a lot in TV while they are racing against each other, and the 911 is the one of the best sales worldwide.</p>
  </ul>

        <dd>- Shaymin is a small cute, hedgehog-like Pokémon with a green grassy back and white fur, often seen with pink flowers on its head.</dd>
        <p></p>I like shaymin because it was the last Pokemon anime I watched and it included Shaymin in it.</p>

        <dd>- Snorlax is a large, bear-like Pokémon with a round body, known for its constant sleeping and massive appetite. He always found napping in the wild in the shows, only waking up to eat variety amounts of food like apples.</dd>
        <p> I chose snorlax because he loves eating, I eat a lot too, and we are pretty similar.</p>

        <p>Charizard is one of my favorite Pokemon because he was one of my first Pokemon Mega Chardizrd EX that I pulled while ripping Pokemon packs and collect cards back then.</p> 
      
      <dt>Dawn Wings Necrozma</dt>   
      <br>

        <dd>- It is a mysterious, prism-like Pokémon with a dark, light blue wings that radiates light energy. It's has the ability to absorb and manipulate light, Necrozma transforms into more powerful forms, making it a very difficult Pokemon to defeat.</dd>
        <p>Necrozma is my recently favorite Pokemon and it's crazy to look at it because it got so many forms and unique about it when they attack with certain kinds of move set.</p>

      <dt>Ceruledge</dt>
        <br>

        <dd>- Necrozma has a dark armor, with blazing blue flames emerging from its arms, which it uses as swords. It looks like a fierce combat style that has a combination of different moves, making it both strong and powerful.</dd>
        <p>Ceruledge is very nice and chose as my favorite Pokemon not too long ago when I got it on my game Pokemon GO and my first seeing it I was shocked to see how insane it looks.</p>
